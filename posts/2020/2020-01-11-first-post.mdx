# Hello, World!

Hello, World! This is my first blog post.

In this blog I'm planning to talk about software engineering, web development, programming languages,
data structures and algorithms, blockchain, aritificial intelligence, machine learning, IoT, etc.
My main goal is to learn the topics myself and try to explain it in a simpler way (if possible).
This way I get to learn twice.
